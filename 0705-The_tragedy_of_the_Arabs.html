        <td>A THOUSAND years ago, the great cities of Baghdad, Damascus and Cairo took turns to race ahead of the Western world. Islam and innovation were twins. The various Arab caliphates were dynamic superpowers—beacons of learning, tolerance and trade. Yet today the Arabs are in a wretched state. Even as Asia, Latin America and Africa advance, the Middle East is held back by despotism and convulsed by war.</td>
        <td>千年以前，伟大的城市巴格达、大马士革和开罗，轮流引领西方世界。伊斯兰教和创新就像一对孪生兄弟。不同的阿拉伯哈里发王朝不断地成为超级大国——学术上的灯塔、宽容[?译]和贸易。但是，今天阿拉伯变成了不幸的地区。即使在亚洲、拉丁美洲和非洲，中东由专制政权控制，因为战争而剧烈震动[?译]。</td>

        <td>Why Arab countries have so miserably failed to create democracy, happiness or (aside from the windfall of oil) wealth for their 350m people is one of the great questions of our time. What makes Arab society susceptible to vile regimes and fanatics bent on destroying them (and their perceived allies in the West)? No one suggests that the Arabs as a people lack talent or suffer from some pathological antipathy to democracy. But for the Arabs to wake from their nightmare, and for the world to feel safe, a great deal needs to change.</td>

          <span class="subtitle">The blame game</span><br>
          One problem is that the Arab countries' troubles run so wide. Indeed, Syria and Iraq can nowadays barely be called countries at all. This week a brutal band of jihadists declared their boundaries void, heralding instead a new Islamic caliphate to embrace Iraq and Greater Syria (including Israel-Palestine, Lebanon, Jordan and bits of Turkey) and—in due course—the whole world. Its leaders seek to kill non-Muslims not just in the Middle East but also in the streets of New York, London and Paris. Egypt is back under military rule. Libya, following the violent demise of Muammar Qaddafi, is at the mercy of unruly militias. Yemen is beset by insurrection, infighting and al-Qaeda. Palestine is still far from true statehood and peace: the murders of three young Israelis and ensuing reprisals threaten to set off yet another cycle of violence (see article). Even countries such as Saudi Arabia and Algeria, whose regimes are cushioned by wealth from oil and gas and propped up by an iron-fisted apparatus of state security, are more fragile than they look. Only Tunisia, which opened the Arabs' bid for freedom three years ago, has the makings of a real democracy.</td>
        <td><span class="subtitle">推卸责任</span><br>
          一个问题是阿拉伯国家的麻烦如此之广。事实上，叙利亚和伊拉克在今天已经不能称为一个国家了。在本周，一个野蛮的圣战者组织宣布他们的国家已经清空，通报一个新的伊斯兰哈里发拥抱伊拉克和大叙利亚（包括以色列-巴勒斯坦、黎巴嫩、约旦和土耳其的小片部分）——在适当的时候——甚至整个世界。这个组织的领导者追求不仅杀掉中东地区的非穆斯林，而且还要纽约、伦敦和巴黎的街头。埃及回到了军人统治。利比亚，跟随着猛烈的卡扎菲之后的转换，在不守规矩的民兵的摆布之下。也门被暴动、斗争和基地组织所困扰。巴勒斯坦距离真正的成为国家并且保持和平还很远：谋杀三名以色列青年和接着发生的报复威胁引起另一个暴力的循环。甚至像沙特阿拉伯和阿尔及利亚，他们的政权由石油和天然气财富缓冲，由铁腕政权机构支持的国家安全，比起看起来更脆弱。在突尼斯，在三年前开启阿拉伯试图自由，已经创建了真正的民主。</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>Islam, or at least modern reinterpretations of it, is at the core of some of the Arabs' deep troubles. The faith's claim, promoted by many of its leading lights, to combine spiritual and earthly authority, with no separation of mosque and state, has stunted the development of independent political institutions. A militant minority of Muslims are caught up in a search for legitimacy through ever more fanatical interpretations of the Koran. Other Muslims, threatened by militia violence and civil war, have sought refuge in their sect. In Iraq and Syria plenty of Shias and Sunnis used to marry each other; too often today they resort to maiming each other. And this violent perversion of Islam has spread to places as distant as northern Nigeria and northern England.</td>
        <td>伊斯兰教，或者至少对它的现代的重新解释，是一些阿拉伯深层问题的核心。宗教宣称，由许多它的重要规则推进，结合了精神和世俗的权力，不区分宗教和国家，已经阻碍了独立政权的发展。少数穆斯林激进分子被逮捕在一次通过更激进的古兰经的解释寻找合法性。其他穆斯林，受民兵武装和内战的威胁，在他们的教派寻找避难。在伊拉克和叙利亚，许多什叶派和逊尼派在过去可以结婚；在今天经常伤害对方。这种伊斯兰的暴力心态已经传播到尼日利亚和埃及北部。</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>But religious extremism is a conduit for misery, not its fundamental cause (see article). While Islamic democracies elsewhere (such as Indonesia—see article) are doing fine, in the Arab world the very fabric of the state is weak. Few Arab countries have been nations for long. The dead hand of the Turks' declining Ottoman empire was followed after the first world war by the humiliation of British and French rule. In much of the Arab world the colonial powers continued to control or influence events until the 1960s. Arab countries have not yet succeeded in fostering the institutional prerequisites of democracy—the give-and-take of parliamentary discourse, protection for minorities, the emancipation of women, a free press, independent courts and universities and trade unions.</td>
        <td>但是宗教极端主义只是不幸的管道[?译]，而不是根本原因。伊斯兰民主在其他地方（比如印度尼西亚）就做的很好，在阿拉伯世界国家的结构很脆弱。很少有阿拉伯国家建国很久。刚刚脱离奥斯曼土耳其的通知，紧接着在第一次世界大战之后，又遭到英国和法国控制的羞辱。在大多数阿拉伯世界殖民者的力量一直影响到20世界60年代。阿拉伯国家甚至没有形成习惯的民主的先决条件——国会讨论的妥协，对少数派的保护，妇女解放，出版自由，独立法庭和大学还有贸易组织。</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>The absence of a liberal state has been matched by the absence of a liberal economy. After independence, the prevailing orthodoxy was central planning, often Soviet-inspired. Anti-market, anti-trade, pro-subsidy and pro-regulation, Arab governments strangled their economies. The state pulled the levers of economic power—especially where oil was involved. Where the constraints of post-colonial socialism were lifted, capitalism of the crony, rent-seeking kind took hold, as it did in the later years of Egypt's Hosni Mubarak. Privatisation was for pals of the government. Virtually no markets were free, barely any world-class companies developed, and clever Arabs who wanted to excel in business or scholarship had to go to America or Europe to do so.</td>
        <td>缺乏自由的国家同样也缺乏自由的经济。独立之后，占优势的正统派实行中央计划，经常苏联模式。反市场、反贸易、支持补贴、支持控制，阿拉伯政府抑制了他们的经济。那些国家拉大经济力量水平——特别是包含石油的国家。过去的殖民主义社会主义的强制发展起来，裙带资本主义，寻租行为扎根，像过去几年埃及的穆巴拉克。私有化是政府的好朋友。几乎没有市场是自由的，极少有世界级的公司发展，那些聪明的想在贸易或学术上有所作为的阿拉伯人都去了美国或者欧洲。</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>Economic stagnation bred dissatisfaction. Monarchs and presidents-for-life defended themselves with secret police and goons. The mosque became a source of public services and one of the few places where people could gather and hear speeches. Islam was radicalised and the angry men who loathed their rulers came to hate the Western states that backed them. Meanwhile a vast number of the young grew restless because of unemployment. Thanks to the electronic media, they were increasingly aware that the prospects of their cohort outside the Middle East were far more hopeful. The wonder is not that they took to the streets in the Arab spring, but that they did not do so sooner.</td>
        <td>经济的不景气导致不满。君王和终身总统用秘密警察和受雇暴徒来防御民众。清真寺变成了公共服务的一个来源，也是少有的人们可以聚集倾听演讲的地方。伊斯兰变得激进化，愤怒的痛恨他们的统治者的人们开始恨背后支持他们的西方国家。同时，大量的年轻人因为失业变得更加焦躁不安。多亏了电子媒体，他们逐渐意识到他们的在中东以外的支持者的前景是更有希望的。奇妙的不是他们在阿拉伯之春的街上得到的，而是他们没有抢先做的[?译]。

          <span class="subtitle">A lot of ruin</span><br>
          These wrongs cannot easily or rapidly be put right. Outsiders, who have often been drawn to the region as invaders and occupiers, cannot simply stamp out the jihadist cause or impose prosperity and democracy. That much, at least, should be clear after the disastrous invasion and occupation of Iraq in 2003. Military support—the supply of drones and of a small number of special forces—may help keep the jihadists in Iraq at bay. That help may have to be on permanent call. Even if the new caliphate is unlikely to become a recognisable state, it could for many years produce jihadists able to export terrorism.</td>
        <td><span class="subtitle">许多破坏</span><br>
          这些错误并不能简单快速地改正。局外人，曾经经常侵略和占领这个区域的，不能简单的毁掉圣战者的动机或者强制繁荣和独立。至少，在2003年损失惨重的入侵占领伊拉克应该能说明这个。军方支持——无人机的支持和少量特种力量——或许可以使伊拉克的圣战者陷入困境。帮助或许需要永久的必要。即使新的伊斯兰国不能变成一个重新可感知的国家[?译]，它仍然可以在很多年提供圣战者，输出恐怖主义。</td>

      <tr>
        <td>But only the Arabs can reverse their civilisational decline, and right now there is little hope of that happening. The extremists offer none. The mantra of the monarchs and the military men is “stability”. In a time of chaos, its appeal is understandable, but repression and stagnation are not the solution. They did not work before; indeed they were at the root of the problem. Even if the Arab awakening is over for the moment, the powerful forces that gave rise to it are still present. The social media which stirred up a revolution in attitudes cannot be uninvented. The men in their palaces and their Western backers need to understand that stability requires reform.</td>
        <td>但是只有阿拉伯可以反转他们的文明衰落，而现在反转的希望很小。极端主义者没有提供任何帮助。最高统治者的颂歌和军方的人仍然稳固。在嘈杂的时代，它的要求是可以理解的，但是镇压和停滞不是解决办法。它们在过去没有起作用；实际上，它们是问题的根源。即使阿拉伯觉醒在那一刻已经结束，强有力的权力造成这样仍然存在。引起想法革命的社会媒体不能不被发明。那些在宫殿的人和他们的西方支持者需要理解稳定需要改革。</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>Is that a vain hope? Today the outlook is bloody. But ultimately fanatics devour themselves. Meanwhile, wherever possible, the moderate, secular Sunnis who comprise the majority of Arab Muslims need to make their voices heard. And when their moment comes, they need to cast their minds back to the values that once made the Arab world great. Education underpinned its primacy in medicine, mathematics, architecture and astronomy. Trade paid for its fabulous metropolises and their spices and silks. And, at its best, the Arab world was a cosmopolitan haven for Jews, Christians and Muslims of many sects, where tolerance fostered creativity and invention.</td>
        <td>那是一个徒劳的希望吗？今天，前景是血腥的。但是，极度的狂热吞噬了他们自己。同时，只要有可能，温和的、世俗的组成大部分阿拉伯穆斯林的逊尼派应该让他们的声音被听到。当他们的时刻来临，把他们的思想投射到价值观上[?译]，那些曾经使阿拉伯世界伟大。教育应该确定为首位，在医疗、数学、建筑和航空技术上。贸易因他们的难以置信的大城市和他们的香料和丝绸得到报酬[?译]。过去最好的时候，阿拉伯世界是世界性的港口，犹太人、基督徒和不同教派的穆斯林，是一个用宽容培育创造力和发明的地方[?译]。

        <td>Pluralism, education, open markets: these were once Arab values and they could be so again. Today, as Sunnis and Shias tear out each others' throats in Iraq and Syria and a former general settles onto his new throne in Egypt, they are tragically distant prospects. But for a people for whom so much has gone so wrong, such values still make up a vision of a better future.</td>
        <td>多元化、教育、开放市场：这些曾经是阿拉伯的价值观，它们应该可以重现。今天，在伊拉克和叙利亚，逊尼派和什叶派互相斗争，在埃及过去的大将走上他的王位[?译]，是悲剧的遥远的景象。但是，对于走错的人们，这些价值观仍然形成一种更好的未来。</td>
