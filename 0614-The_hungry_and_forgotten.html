        <td>THE propaganda message, scrawled in white paint on the side of a wood-frame house, could hardly be more blunt: “Cure stupidity, cure poverty”. The cure for both, in one of China’s poorest counties, seems to be a daily nutritional supplement for children. At a pre-school centre in Songjia, as in more than 600 other poor villages across China, children aged three to six gather to get the stuff with their lunch. If China is to narrow its urban-rural divide, thousands more villages will need to do this much, or more. Widespread malnutrition still threatens to hold back a generation of rural Chinese.</td>
        <td>用白色涂料涂写在木质房屋的一边的宣传消息变得更呆板：“消除愚昧，消除贫穷”。这两个消除，在中国最贫困的乡村之一，意味着为儿童的每日营养餐。在一个位于宋家中心的学前学校，像遍布中国的多于600个的其他贫困村庄一样，年龄在3到6岁的儿童聚集在一起领取午餐。如果中国可以缩小它的城乡差距，成千的村庄需要这么做，或者更多。广阔的营养不良仍然威胁者并阻碍者一代中国农村中国人。</td>

      <tr>
        <td>China used to have more undernourished people than anywhere in the world except India: about 300m, or 30% of the population in 1980. Economic growth has pulled half of them out of poverty and hunger. But that still leaves about 150m, mainly in the countryside. Out of 88m children aged six to 15 in the poorest rural areas, around a third suffer from anaemia because of a lack of iron, according to survey data. Iron deficiency can stunt brain development, meaning many of these children will grow up ill-equipped to better their lot. “They are far behind compared with urban kids,” says Lu Mai, secretary-general of China Development Research Foundation (CDRF), a government-run charity. Mr Lu and other experts have been prodding the government to do more. The state subsidises school lunches for 23m children in the 680 poorest counties, as well as nutritional supplements for hundreds of thousands of babies. It is not enough.</td>
        <td>中国曾经的营养不良人口比世界上除了印度的都要多：大约3亿，占了1980年人口的30%。经济增长使其中的一般人脱离了贫困和饥饿。但是仍然剩下1.5亿，这其中大多数在农村。通过调查数据，超过8千8百万年龄在6到15岁的儿童在最贫困村庄区域，大约1/3因为缺铁而贫血。缺铁会阻碍大脑发育，意味着他们中的大多数将成长不够聪明来改善他们的命运。“他们与城市儿童相比差距很大”，LuMai说，LuMai是中国发展研究委员会的秘书长，由政府运营的慈善组织。Lu先生和其他专家已经促使政府做了更多。政府为680个最贫困村的2千3百万儿童资助的学校午餐，还有为成千上万的婴儿的营养餐。但这还不够。</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>Even where children get the calories they need—as most do in rural China—they are not being fed the right things. In one study of 1,800 infants in rural Shaanxi province in China’s north-west, 49% were anaemic and 40% were significantly hampered in developing either cognitive or motor skills. Fewer than one in ten were stunted or wasting, meaning that in most cases the problem was not lack of calories, but lack of nutrients.</td>
        <td>甚至那些获得需要能量的儿童，大多数在中国农村，他们也没有吃到正确的食物。在一份基于1800个中国西北的陕西农村的婴儿的研究中，49%的贫血，40%在认识和运动能力发展上明显受阻。只有不到1/10发育不良或者消瘦，意味着大多数情况下，问题在于缺乏营养而不是缺少能量。</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>China shares this affliction with much of the developing world. But it has the resources to respond. Parents have the means to feed their babies properly. And with a relatively modest investment, the government could do a better job of improving childhood nutrition. The difficulties lie in educating parents—and officials.</td>
        <td>
          中国与发展中国家分享这些苦恼。但是中国有足够的财力来作出回应。父母有意愿使用正确的方法喂养他们的婴儿。使用相对适中的投资，政府可以为提高儿童营养状况做的更好。困难在于对父母的引导和官方的。</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>“Babies are probably 50% malnourished” in poor rural areas, says Scott Rozelle, co-director of the Rural Education Action Programme (REAP), a research outfit at Stanford University which has done extensive tests on anaemia in rural China. “But almost no mums are malnourished.” Mr Rozelle says that in one of his surveys rural mothers showed a better understanding of how to feed pigs than babies: 71% said pigs need micronutrients, whereas only 20% said babies need them.</td>
        <td>“婴儿或许有50%营养不良”在贫困农村区域，农村教育行动计划的局长Scott Rozelle说，这是来自斯坦福大学的一个研究组织，他们已经在中国农村做过范围很广的贫血测试。“但是几乎没有母亲是营养不良的”。Rozelle先生说，在他的一项研究中发现农村母亲表现的在怎样养猪上比养小孩更懂：她们中的71%说猪需要微量营养素，而只有20%说婴儿也需要。</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>Mr Lu’s charity and REAP argue that a nutritional supplement called ying yang bao should be available to rural mothers. A powdery concoction of soyabeans, iron, zinc, calcium and vitamins, it is supposed to be sprinkled on food once a day. Each packet costs less than one yuan (16 cents) to produce and one yuan to distribute, paid by the government.</td>
        <td>Lu先生的机构和REAP建议一种名为营养宝的营养食品应该提供给农村母亲。一种大豆、铁、锌、钙和维生素的粉末状调合物，建议每天一次撒在食物上。每一包花费少于1元（16美分）来生产，一元来分发，由政府承担。</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>Trials conducted since 2006 have consistently shown that ying yang bao reduces anaemia and improves growth and development in infants and toddlers. But persuading parents of this (or grandparents, if the parents are off working in cities) has not been easy. About half give up feeding it to their children. “Poor people feel very suspicious”, Mr Lu says. They wonder if free supplements are unsafe, or fake. “Then they worry will we charge later?”</td>
        <td>从2006年措施实施，一致地表现营养宝可以减少营养不良并且提高婴幼儿的成长和发展。但是要劝说儿童父母（或者祖父母，如果父母在城市工作）接受这些并不容易。大约有一半没有喂他们的孩子营养宝。“穷人觉得非常怀疑”，Lu先生说。他们怀疑免费的供给是否安全或者假的。“然后他们担心我们是否要在以后付钱？”</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>This may be the legacy in rural China of years of seeing government invest little—and often charge a lot—for basic services. Moreover, at the local level the workers who are meant to help mothers may well be family-planning officials responsible for controlling population, a role that hardly inspires trust.</td>
        <td>这或许是在中国农村多年来遗留下来的，政府提供很少、索取很多，仅为了基本服务。另外，在地方级的意在帮助母亲的工作人员或许在计划生育局负责控制人口，几乎不能激起信任。</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>At higher levels of government, too, officials need a lot of persuading that nutrition programmes are not a waste of public money. In 2011 China began instituting a programme similar to America’s federal school-lunch programme for the poor, at a cost of 16 billion yuan ($2.6 billion) a year. But one assessment suggests that perhaps half the schools are providing substandard, uncooked meals, partly because some local governments refuse to foot the bill for kitchens and cooks.</td>
        <td>在政府高层，当局需要表示营养工程不是浪费公众的钱。在2011年，中国开始建立一项与美国联邦学校午餐类似的为了穷人的项目，一年中花费了160亿元（26亿美元）。但是一项评估指出，或许一般的学校提供低于标准、没有烹制的饭，部分原因是因为一些地方政府拒绝结算鸡肉和烹制的账单。</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>In 2012 the health ministry made a modest investment of 100m yuan to provide supplements to 270,000 babies in 100 counties. This year 400,000 babies in 300 counties are meant to get them. Later this year Mr Lu’s charity will begin a tiny pilot of an early-parenting programme, akin to America’s Head Start, in 50 villages, with 50 more villages being used for controlled comparison. James Heckman, an economist and Nobel laureate who has researched early-childhood development, is helping design the study. Such programmes look promising. But they are tiny.</td>
        <td>在2012年，卫生部拿出1亿元的投资用于提供为100个农村的27万婴儿提供补充。这一年，300个农村的40万婴儿有希望得到帮助。今年晚些时候，Lu先生的慈善机构将开始一项针对年轻父母的小试验，类似美国的开端，在50个农村，同时另外50个农村作为对比。James Heckman，作为经济学家和诺贝尔奖获得者，曾经研究早期童年发展，帮助设计了这项研究。这样的项目看上去很有希望。但是很小。</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>Part of the problem in getting local or provincial governments to spend money on childhood nutrition is that the payoffs are years in the making. And the returns might not go to the village or province, but to cities miles away, in the form of more skilled workers who move there. Central ministries are keen to invest, Mr Lu says, but they want to spend their cash on things that officials crave more than children do—like buildings in villages for each ministry.</td>
        <td>使地方和省级政府在儿童营养上花钱的部分问题是结算是看每年做出了什么。反馈或许不会在农村或省，而是相距很远的城市，以更多熟练工人移入的方式。中央局希望投资，Lu先生说，但是他们向使用他们的资金在当局更看重的比如为政府部门的农村建设而不是为儿童。</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>For Mr Lu one kind of building does promise a big payoff—village early-education centres, or preschools. His charity has set them up in 677 villages, often using redundant elementary schools. In Songjia village Tian Lin, 22, and her older sister, Tian Hongjiao, teach 26 children aged three to six, including the younger sister’s own three-year-old son. They cook lunch with whatever the children bring from home. Those with migrant-worker parents, who are a bit better off, may have a chunk of pork; others bring a meagre potato or vegetable. Either way all the children get a ying yang bao with their lunch.</td>
        <td>对于Lu，一个建筑意味着一个大报酬——农村早教中心，或者学前学校。他的组织已经在677个农村建立学校，大多使用多余的小学。在宋家村，22岁的TianLin和它的姐姐TianHongjiao，教26个年龄在3到6岁的儿童，这其中包括妹妹自己的三岁的儿子。他们用儿童们自己从家带来的食物做午餐。那些父母在外打工的儿童会好一点，或许会有一块猪肉；另外一些带来一点土豆或蔬菜。无论哪种，所有的儿童获得一份营养宝在他们的午餐中。</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>In 2012 a study found the anaemia rate among the three- to five-year-olds in this county was close to 18%, more than twice the average for poor rural areas nationwide, according to Mr Lu’s CDRF. He reckons that, on coming to the centres, the children show only 20% of the memory retention of their urban counterparts and 40-60% of their language abilities and cognition. But nutritional supplements help. A study of nine- and ten-year olds, co-written by Mr Rozelle, found that taking a daily chewable vitamin with iron for six months not only cut anaemia levels. It also improved their maths.</td>
        <td>在2012年，一项研究发现在这些农村在3到5岁的儿童中贫血率接近18%，是全国贫困地区平均水平的2倍，依据Lu的CDRF。他估计，在来到中心的，这些儿童表现的只有它们城市竞争者的20%的记忆力，40-60%的语言能力和认知能力。但是营养提供是有帮助的。一项针对9到10岁的调查，由Rozelle先生合作，发现使用每天咀嚼含铁维生素持续6个月不仅降低了缺铁率。还提高了它们的计算水平。</td>
