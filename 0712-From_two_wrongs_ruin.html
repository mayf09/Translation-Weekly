        <td>AFTER more than a week of steadily rising temperatures, Israel and Palestine are aflame. The discovery on June 30th of the bodies of three Jewish teenagers, kidnapped while hitchhiking home from bible college to a settlement south of Jerusalem, was followed two days later by the apparent revenge killing of a Palestinian. Within days, riots that followed the murders had escalated to volleys of rocket fire from Gaza, which have been met by Israeli strikes. As if from nowhere, Israel and Palestine find themselves facing their worst military confrontation since Israel's "Cast Lead" offensive in Gaza five years ago.</td>
        <td>在持续一周的温度稳步上升之后，以色列和巴勒斯坦爆发了。6月30日发现三名犹太青年的遗体，在他们搭便车从圣经大学去耶路撒冷南部的一个定居点的途中被绑架，在两天后被一个巴勒斯坦人因为报复行为而杀害。几天时间内，因为谋杀引起的骚乱已经逐步升级到从加沙的火箭炮发射，由以色列发动攻击[?译]。好像从任何地方，以色列和巴勒斯坦发现他们面临着自从5年前以色列“铸铅行动”之后最严重的武装冲突。</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>Sirens sounding from the Gaza border to north of Tel Aviv have sent Israelis running for shelter. Militants in Gaza are firing Syrian M-302 rockets, able to reach Haifa, 100 miles (160 kilometres) to the north, according to army officials. More than 200 rockets have landed in Israel. Israel has struck back from the air, sea and land with 780 strikes, reducing buildings in Gazan cities to rubble after calling residents with a few minutes' notice. When a family climbed on their home's roof to act as a human shield, the strikes continued, killing seven. Palestinian hospitals say that at least 68 have died so far. Israel's army has approved the call-up of 40,000 reservists. Its border guard and army are battling dozens of violent protests in Israel's Palestinian towns and the occupied West Bank.</td>
        <td>从加沙边境到特拉维夫的呼啸声让以色列人躲到了防空洞里。有军官称，加沙的好战分子发射的 M-302 火箭弹，可以到达海法，朝北100英里（160公里）。已经有超过200枚火箭弹落入以色列境内。以色列从空中、海上、陆地上予以还击，共进行了780次攻击[?译]，在提醒居民注意的很短时间内，将一些加沙的建筑变成废墟。当一个家庭跑到他们的房顶表示是民居的时候，袭击还是进行了，7人丧生。巴勒斯坦医院表示至今至少有68人丧生。以色列军队批准召集4万名预备军人。以色列的边境防御，军队制止了十几起以色列巴勒斯坦人聚居村镇的暴力抗议，同时占领了河西岸[?译]。</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>The escalation has demolished an uneasy peace. Safe behind their walls and the protective umbrella of the Iron Dome anti-missile system, many Israelis had begun to forget about security. Political party leaders focused on economic affairs. Whenever Palestinians were uppity, Binyamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, promoted “conflict management”, a euphemism for muddling through.</td>
        <td>战争升级破坏了好不容易得到的和平。安全的躲在墙后面同时有铁穹反导系统的保护，许多以色列人开始忘记安全。政党领导专注于经济事务。无论何时巴勒斯坦是不易控制的，以色列总理，内塔尼亚胡，推动“冲突管理”，一种得过且过的委婉说法[?译]。</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>Suddenly, the centre-right ground that Mr Netanyahu has dominated by tinkering and sidestepping big decisions for five years is slipping from under him. “Mr Netanyahu has lost the greatest asset of his tenure—security and calm,” says Ofer Zalzberg, an Israeli political analyst. “If he doesn’t regain it, he will fall.” The country is polarising between those who want a peace settlement and those who support military action. A poll conducted on July 2nd, as tensions began to bubble over, showed parties on the far-right and left had benefited. The small left-wing party, Meretz, doubled its support.</td>
        <td>突然，中右派观点的内塔尼亚胡[??译]。“内塔尼亚胡失去了对于他的职位的最大的价值——安全和冷静，”Ofer Zalzberg 表示，他是一名以色列政治分析家。“如果他不能曾获它们，他会下台。”这个国家两极分化：一部分人希望和平解决，一部分人支持军事行动。7月2日的一项民意调查，伴随着矛盾不断激化，表明极右派和左派政党已经受益。温和左翼政党梅雷兹党获得了以往两倍的支持。</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>On July 7th, as the prime minister vacillated, Avigdor Lieberman, the foreign minister and Mr Netanyahu’s former chief of staff, ended a partnership with the prime minister’s Likud party, taking his ten parliamentarians with him and calling for a heavy offensive against Hamas. Reluctantly, and in part to shore up his right-wing flank, Mr Netanyahu launched a campaign of air strikes the next day, named “Operation Protective Edge”. Public pressure for a ground assault is mounting. “Bibi’s afraid,” says a Tel Aviv bus driver, who flies the colours of his infantry regiment above a swaying fluffy doll pinned in the cabin of his bus.</td>
        <td>7月7日，随着总理的摇摆不定，Avigdor Lieberman ，外交部长和内塔尼亚胡的前任参谋主管，结束了他们在总理的利库德党的生涯，带着10名议员，主张对哈马斯实施猛烈进攻。很不情愿，同时一部分为了支持他的右翼，内塔尼亚胡在第二天发动了一场空袭，称为“保护边境行动”。对于陆地攻击的来自民众的压力是巨大的。“Bibi 害怕”，一位特拉维夫的公交车司机说，他驾驶着一辆步兵团颜色的，车厢上面别着一个摇摆的毛绒玩具的大巴。</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>Mr Netanyahu's ministers talk confidently of reimposing deterrence on Gaza's armed Islamists, including the two dominant groups, Hamas and Islamic Jihad. “Quiet for quiet,” says Moshe Ya'alon, Israel's defence minister. But it may not be that simple. Until a few weeks ago, Israeli generals were congratulating themselves on how much more feeble Hamas had become since its abandonment by Egypt's new hardline government. Since Abdel Fatah al-Sisi came to power, Egypt's security co-operation with Israel has reached new levels. Egypt now regards Hamas as a terrorist organisation. Around 95% of the tunnels used to smuggle cars, concrete, fuel, missile parts and more into Gaza and jihadists into Sinai have been shut down by the Egyptian army. Isolated by sanctions, the tunnels were Gaza's economic lifeline.</td>
        <td>内塔尼亚胡的部长对于在加沙的武装伊斯兰分子重新增加威慑很有信心，包括两个主要的组织，哈马斯和吉哈德。“为了安静而安静，”以色列国防部长Moshe Ya'alon 说。但是好像不是那么简单。直到几周前，以色列将军鼓励他们，自从被埃及的新强硬政府放弃，哈马斯变得非常弱。自从塞西执政，埃及与以色列的安全合作达到了一个新高度。埃及现在把哈马斯当成一个恐怖组织。大约 95% 的过去用于走私骑车、水泥、石油、导弹零件和更多进入加沙还有圣战者进入西塞的隧道被埃及军队关闭。被制裁隔离，这些隧道本是加沙的经济命脉。</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>In its desperation, Hamas has returned to the battlefield. “Deterrence needs an address,” says an Israeli military analyst. Out of government, Gaza's guerrillas will be harder to reduce to submission. Some say they relish the prospect of an Israeli reoccupation, which will give them an enemy they can see. And their improved military capabilities—demolition of supply tunnels notwithstanding—have bolstered their standing among alienated segments of the 1.6m Palestinians in Israel, as well as in the West Bank, which is under the partial control of President Mahmoud Abbas.</td>
        <td>在衰落的过程中，哈马斯重回战争。“威慑需要一个地址[?译]，”一位以色列军事分析员说。政府之外，加沙的游击队员很难减少，不会投降。一些人说他们欣赏以色列全神贯注的前景[??译]，这样给出他们能看见的敌人。并且他们先进的军队能力——尽管破坏供给隧道——支持部分的在以色列160万巴勒斯坦人支持他们的，同时在西岸，有部分在阿巴斯的控制下[?译]。</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>Mr Abbas's security forces seem nervous when venturing out of their bases. Though they operate under the umbrella of Israel's security establishment, they face calls from the street for protection from Israel's increasingly intrusive army. "Relatives call me a traitor for working here," says a diplomat in Mr Abbas's foreign ministry. When one of Mr Abbas's ministers arrived at the mourning tent for Mohammed Abu Khudeir, the 16-year-old whom religious Jews had allegedly kidnapped and burned alive on July 2nd, mourners chased him away. Mr Abbas's Palestinian Authority is in danger of becoming a shell.</td>
        <td>当走出营地时，阿巴斯的安全部队似乎很紧张。虽然他们在以色列安全局的保护下行动，但是他们面对召唤因为在街上以色列增长的闯入军队保护[?译]。“亲戚们认为我在这工作把我当成叛徒”，一个阿巴斯的外交局的外交官说。当一名阿巴斯部长到达为穆罕默德哀悼的帐篷，穆罕默德是一名16岁的男孩，被极端犹太分子绑架在7月2日被杀害，哀悼者让他走。阿巴斯的巴勒斯坦政策恐怕会变成一个空壳。</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>Leadership of Israel's Arabs is as parlous. Disconnected from social media, it seems out of the loop. "We are against the chaos, but when I say stop, they don't listen," says an Arab parliamentarian, sitting at the calm of his Knesset desk as riots rage in his home town of Um-al Fahm. Protesters have sporadically closed Israel's highways in the north and south. Masked men throw stones at traffic in the Galilee, where Arabs comprise half the population, and the Bedouin concentrations of the Negev.</td>
        <td>以色列阿拉伯人的首领不确定。与社会媒体断开连接，好像置身讯息圈外。“我们反对混乱，但是当我要求停火，没有人听，”一位阿拉伯国会议员表示，镇定地坐在他的国会桌前，而此时他的家乡 Umal Fahm 正遭受暴乱。在南方和北方抗议者零星地接近以色列的公路。在加利利，阿拉伯人占了一半，蒙面人往路上仍石块，贝都因人集中在内格夫[?译]。</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>Outrage at Mr Abu Khudeir's murder is the spark; Israel's assaults in Gaza add fuel. But frustration at their secondary place in a Jewish state provides the firewood. Some Israeli Arabs speak of becoming a new centre of Palestinian gravity as they wage an "economic intifada" to chase foreign investment away. "We want Jews to feel that when Palestinians suffer on the far side of the wall, they pay a price on this side of the wall too," says a student from the Galilee studying at an Israeli university. For everyone, the ruinous costs are rising.</td>
        <td>杀害阿布 胡达伊尔的暴行是导火索；以色列在加沙的攻击又火上浇油。但是在他们的在犹太州第二个地方的挫败提供了柴火。一些以色列阿拉伯人成为巴勒斯坦人重要性的新的中心，他们实行“经济暴动”驱赶外国投资。“我们希望犹太人知道，当巴勒斯坦人在墙的一面遭受苦难，他们也要在另一面付出代价，”一名在加利利以色列大学的学生说。对于每个人，破坏性的代价还在增加。</td>
