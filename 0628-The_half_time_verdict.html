        <td>THE winners of the football World Cup will not be known until July 13th. But the tournament is already a sporting success. Draws, especially of the goalless variety, have been mercifully rare (see chart). Not since 1958 have so many goals been scored per game in the group stage of a World Cup. What about off the pitch?
        </td>
        <td>世界杯冠军在7月13日才会有结果。但是世界杯已经成功。平局，特别是0:0的平局幸运地很少出现。这是1958年以来，在世界杯舞台上每场比赛有这么多进球。那么绿茵场外呢？</td>

        <td>Start with Brazil's economy. On the whole, economists agree, big sporting events have negligible impact on output. Money for the infrastructure bonanza beloved of politicians is not conjured from thin air; it is diverted from elsewhere. Productivity dips, too. Holidays have been decreed on some match days to ease pressure on creaking public transport. Before the Brazil-Cameroon game on June 23rd, for example, Brasília was a ghost town; to spare fans inevitable gridlock, public institutions and private firms let workers off early.</td>
        <td>首先说巴西的经济。总体上说来，经济学家表示，大型运动会对产量的影响微乎其微。政客们热爱的基础设施建设的钱不是凭空变出来的；那是从别处转移得到的。同样，还有生产力倾斜。在一些比赛日，法律规定了假期用来缓解拥挤的公共交通。比如，在6月23日巴西-喀麦隆比赛时，在巴西利亚，整个城市变的空旷[译：ghost town]；为了减少球迷们不必要的拥塞，公共部门和私有公司的员工提前下班。</td>

        <td>The São Paulo Federation of Commerce reckons the output lost as a result could reach 30 billion reais ($14 billion), about as much as all World Cup investment put together. Tourism-related earnings, which the government puts at 6.7 billion reais, will not offset this. For every football fan coming to see his team play a tourist is put off by the crowds and the prices. Business shindigs in popular destinations like São Paulo or Recife, in Pernambuco state, have been cancelled. Gelsa Lima, who runs a food stall at the bus terminal in Natal, capital of Rio Grande do Norte, complains that business is no better than usual. The state tourism secretary's expectation of a net 300,000 extra visitors this year compared with 2013 looks optimistic.</td>
        <td>圣保罗商业联盟估计，效益损失可以达到300亿雷亚尔（140亿美元），大约和整个世界杯的收入一样多。旅游相关的收入，政府拨款的67亿雷亚尔，无法抵消这个损失。对于每一个来看他支持的球队的球迷作为一个旅客，被人群和价格分散[译：put off]。在流行的目的地比如圣保罗和累西腓的经济shindigs，在伯南布哥，已经取消了。Gelsa Lima，在北里约德格的首府纳塔尔的一个公交终点站经营一个足球商店，抱怨生意还没有平时好了。州旅游部长希望今年比2013年净增30万旅客看来是可以实现的。</td>

      <tr>
        <td>Host cities did score some new infrastructure (though many question whether it was the sort they most urgently needed). Natal got a snazzy airport. Taxi drivers in Recife say traffic has eased thanks to a new viaduct linking the north and south of the city. Brasília, Curitiba and Salvador built new motorways to their airports. Severe flooding due to unusually heavy rains which hit Natal in the past week “would have been worse had it not been for the Copa”, says Demétrio Torres, special secretary for World Cup affairs in Rio Grande do Norte. A joint operations centre created for the occasion helped police, firemen and civil defence to co-ordinate their actions. As part of its preparations, the city also began building a new drainage system.</td>
        <td>主办城市得到一些新基础设施（尽管还存在很多问题这是不是他们最想得到的）。纳塔尔得到一个漂亮的机场。在累西腓的出租车司机说交通缓解了多亏了一座连接城市南北的高架桥。巴西利亚，库里提巴和萨尔瓦多铺设了通向机场的高速公路。由猛烈大雨引起的严重的洪水在上周袭击了纳塔尔，“在没有copa前会更严重”，Demetrio Torres表示，他是北里约格朗德世界杯事件秘书长。一个共同的操作中心用来帮助警察、消防员和民防协调他们的行动的情形。作为准备的一部分，纳塔尔也开始建设新的排水系统。</td>

        <td>Not all of it was ready in time, a recurrent theme in host cities. Of ten urban-mobility projects intended in Curitiba for the Cup, only the airport road has been completed, according to Olga Firkowski, who monitors such schemes at the Federal University of Paraná. In other places many were finished only in injury time. A whiff of setting cement and fresh paint pervades Natal’s new terminal. The coat of asphalt on Salvador's airport road is so fresh that long stretches lack marked lanes.</td>
        <td>并不是上面的所有都及时准备好了，在主办城市的一个周期性的主题。在库里提巴，为了世界杯准备了十个市内移动工程，现在只有机场大道完成了，根据Olga Firkowski ，他是在巴拉那州立大学这些项目的管理者。在其他一些地方，许多在补时阶段才完成。放置水泥和涂料的气味遍布纳塔尔的新航空站。在萨尔瓦多机场大道上的沥青涂层新的很长一段缺少单行道标识。</td>

      <tr>
        <td>Still, supporters cannot complain. Barring the odd traffic jam in São Paulo or on Natal’s dug-up streets, they have faced few hurdles. Flights run on time; buses whisk fans to venues. Adrian Richardson, a Californian fan touring the north-east to watch the United States, concedes that the roads are worse and police presence heavier than during the last World Cup in South Africa. But, he adds, “the parties are better.”</td>
        <td>这样，支持者没有抱怨。在圣保罗和纳塔尔开辟街道封锁临时交通拥挤，他们面对很少障碍。斗争者游行很准时；公交车带着球迷向球场疾驰。Adrian Richardson，一位加州球迷走到东北部来看美国，承认道路很差而且警察比上届在南非的世界杯上多。但是，他补充到“聚会很棒”。</td>

        <td>Activists banking on organisational cock-ups to jolt their countrymen into the sort of protests that brought more than 1m of them onto the streets during a warm-up tournament last June have been disappointed. Add in 147,000 police and soldiers and it is little wonder that anti-Cup demonstrations have so far been mostly small and peaceful.</td>
        <td>激进分子寄希望于组织者提到动摇他们的乡下人???。包括147000警察和士兵，不难理解反对世界杯的游行离减小和和平还很远。</td>

      <tr>
        <td>President Dilma Rousseff should not take too much comfort, however. Although serious snafus would almost certainly have dented her popularity, the smooth running of the finals has not helped it. A survey by IBOPE, a pollster, taken a few days into the competition found that for the first time more Brazilians think Ms Rousseff’s government is doing a bad job than a good one (though she enjoys higher personal ratings). Politicians from her Workers' Party, who this week confirmed Ms Rousseff as their candidate in October's election, had warned against politicising the Cup. They may now wish it were a bit more political.</td>
        <td>不过，总统罗塞夫过得并不舒服。尽管，严重的混乱几乎肯定会削弱她的支持率，最后决赛的顺利进行对这个没有帮助。一项IBOPE的调查，一项民意调查，在比赛进行期间的一些天，表示第一次多数巴西人觉得罗塞夫政府做了一项错误的工作而不是好事（尽管她得到很高的个人评价）。她领导的工人党，推举罗塞夫作为他们在十月选举中的候选人，被警告使世界杯政治化。他们现在应该希望少一点政治。</td>

      <tr>
        <td>If anyone is scoring brownie points it is local governments. Denizens of Salvador attribute their city's infrastructural gains to Antônio Magalhães Neto, a newish mayor whose Democrats party is part of the national opposition. Recife residents credit Eduardo Campos, who stood down as governor of Pernambuco to challenge Ms Rousseff in October, for properly testing the stadiums and transport links. But the World Cup is proving to be mainly about the football. It's a funny old game.</td>
        <td>如果说任何人应该表彰，那就是地方政府。萨尔瓦多的居民贡献他们城市的基础设施给Antonio Magalhaes Neto，一个新市长，他的民主党是国家反对党的一部分。累西腓居民信任Eduardo Campos，他将作为Pernambuco的政府在十月挑战罗塞夫，为了正确地测试体育场和交通线。但是世界杯是大多是关于足球的。这是一项有趣古老的运动。</td>
