      美丽运动，肮脏生意</h2>
    <h5 align="right">Football is a great sport, but it could be so much better if it were run honestyly<br />
      足球是一项伟大的运动，但是如果在诚信下运行它可以变得更好</h5>
    <h6 align="right">Jun 7th 2014 | From the print edition</h6>

    <p class="段落">
      THE <b>mesmerising</b> <b>wizardry</b> of Lionel Messi and the muscular <b>grace</b> of Cristiano Ronaldo are joys to behold.<br />
      But for deep-dyed internationalists like this newspaper, the game's true beauty lies in its long reach, from east to west and north to south.<br />
      Football, more than any other sport, has thrived on globalisation.<br />
      Nearly half of humanity will watch at least part of the World Cup, which kicks off in Brazil on June 12th.<br />

      梅西的催眠魔术和C罗的肌肉魅力将会被看到。<br />
      但是对于像本报一样的真正的国际主义者来说，这项运动的真正美丽的谎言在他的长？，从东到西从南到北。<br />
      不像其他运动，足球在全世界范围内都很狂热。<br />
      将近一半的人将会收看6月12日在巴西开幕的世界杯。
    </p>

    <p class="段落">
      So it is sad that the tournament begins under a cloud as big as the Maracana stadium.<br />
      Documents obtained by Britain's <i>Sunday Times</i> have allegedly revealed secret payments that helped Qatar win the hosting rights to the World Cup in 2022.<br />
      If that competition was fixed, it has company.<br />
      A report by FIFA, football’s governing body, is said to have found that several exhibition matches were rigged ahead of the World Cup in 2010.<br />
      And as usual, no one has been punished.<br />

      所以赛事在像马拉卡纳球场这样的乌云下开始。<br />
      英国的<i>周日时报</i>获得的文件揭示了帮助卡塔尔获得2022世界杯举办权的私下的金钱交易。<br />
      如果<br />
      一份来自FIFA的报道表示，<br />
      也像往常一样，没有人被惩罚。
    </p>

    <p class="段落">
      This only prompts other questions.<br />
      Why on earth did anyone think holding the World Cup in the middle of the Arabian summer was a good idea?<br />
      Why is football so far behind other sports like rugby, cricket and tennis in using technology to doublecheck refereeing decisions?<br />
      And why is the world’s greatest game led by such a group of mediocrities, notably Sepp Blatter, FIFA’s boss since 1998?<br />
      In any other organisation, the endless financial scandals would have led to his ouster years ago.<br />
      But more than that, he seems hopelessly out of date; from sexist remarks about women to interrupting a minute’s silence for Nelson Mandela after only 11 seconds, the 78-year-old is the sort of dinosaur that left corporate boardrooms in the 1970s.<br />
      Nor is it exactly heartening that the attempts to stop Mr Blatter enjoying a fifth term are being led by Michel Platini, Europe’s leading soccercrat, who was once a wonderful midfielder but played a woeful role in supporting the Qatar bid.<br />

      这仅仅唤起了其他问题。<br />
      为什么在这个世界上任何人都觉得在阿拉伯夏天的中间举起世界杯是一个好想法呢？<br />
      为什么足球与其他运动比如说橄榄球、板球和网球如此之远，在使用科技检查裁判决定的方面？<br />
      为什么世界上最伟大的运动被这样一个平庸的组织领导，尤其是赛普·布拉特，自从1998年就一直是国际足联主席？<br />
      在任何其他组织，没完没了的财帐丑闻最终导致罢免在很多年前。<br />
      更多的是，布拉特好像下台无望；从对妇女性别歧视到在持续11秒后<a href="http://sports.163.com/13/1208/08/9FICR2D7000505HF.html">打断为曼德拉的默哀一分钟</a>，这位78岁已经应该归为落伍的人自从1970s离开合作会议室。<br />
      也不是当然的鼓励，由米歇尔·普拉蒂尼主导的尝试阻止布拉特先生第五次连任，普拉蒂尼是欧洲的领导足球统治者，曾经是一个很好的中场，但是在卡塔尔贿选中也扮演了一个很好的角色。

      <h4>Our cheating rotten scoundrels are better than yours<br />
        我们欺骗腐败恶劣比你们强
      </h4>
      <p>
        Many football fans are indifferent to all this.<br />
        What matters to them is the beautiful game, not the tired old suits who run it.<br />
        And FIFA’s moral turpitude is hardly unique.<br />
        The International Olympic Committee, after all, faced a Qatar-like scandal over the awarding of the winter games in 2002 (though it has made a much bigger attempt to clean itself up).<br />
        The boss of Formula One, Bernie Ecclestone, stands accused of bribery in Germany, while American basketball has just had to sack an owner for racist remarks.<br />
        Cricket, the second-most-global sport, has had its own match-fixing scandals.<br />
        American football could be overwhelmed by compensation claims for injuries.<br />

        许多足球迷对这些并不关心。<br />
        他们关心的是漂亮的比赛，而不是谁运行的陈旧的诉讼。<br />
        而且国际足联道德邪恶是及其特别的。<br />
        国际奥林匹克委员会，总的来说，在2002年冬奥会颁奖是面临一个和卡塔尔相似的丑闻（尽管它做了很大努力来洗清自己）。<br />
        F1的主席，伯尼·埃克莱斯顿，站出来谴责在德国的行贿，同时美国篮球正要解雇一个有种族主义言论的老板。<br />
        作为第二全球化运动的板球，曾经由它的比赛造假丑闻。<br />
        美式橄榄球因为受伤补偿要求被淹没。
      </p>

      <p>
        But football fans are wrong to think there is no cost to all this.<br />
        First, corruption and complacency at the top makes it harder to fight skulduggery on the pitch.<br />
        Ever larger amounts of money are now being bet on each game—it may be $1 billion a match at the World Cup.<br />
        Under external pressure to reform, FIFA has recently brought in some good people, including a respected ethics tsar, Mark Pieth.<br />
        But who will listen to lectures about reform from an outfit whose public face is Mr Blatter?<br />

        但是足球迷们认为这些没有代价的想法是错误的。<br />
        首先，上层的腐败和自满使与球场欺诈斗争变得更困难。<br />
        可能大量的钱下注在每场比赛——或许是10亿美元每场世界杯比赛。<br />
        在外界压力下改革，国际足联最近引进了一些好人，其中包括受人尊重的道德沙皇马克·皮斯。<br />
        但是，谁会听一个公众面孔是布拉特先生的组织的关于改革的演讲？
      </p>

      <p>
        Second, big-time corruption isn’t victimless; nor does it end when a host country is chosen.<br />
        For shady regimes—the type that bribe football officials—a major sporting event is also a chance to defraud state coffers, for example by awarding fat contracts to cronies.<br />
        Tournaments that ought to be national celebrations risk becoming festivals of graft.<br />

        其次，一流的腐败并不是没有受害者；也没有在选东道主时停止。<br />
        对于可疑的政权——贿赂足球官员的类型——一个主要的运动事件同时也是贿赂公务资金的机会，例如通过授予丰厚的合同给自己的亲友。<br />
        联赛应该是国家的庆祝却变成了受贿的节日。
      </p>

      <p>
        Finally, there is a great opportunity cost.<br />
        Football is not as global as it might be (see article).<br />
        The game has failed to conquer the world’s three biggest countries: China, India and America.<br />
        In the United States soccer, as they call it, is played but not watched.<br />
        In China and India the opposite is true.<br />
        The latter two will not be playing in Brazil (indeed, they have played in the World Cup finals just once between them).<br />

        最后，巨大的机会成本。<br />
        足球并没有像它可能的那样全球化。<br />
        这项运动没有征服世界上最大的三个国家：中国、印度和美国。<br />
        在美国，用他们的话说，足球是用来踢的而不是看的。<br />
        在中国和印度，对立面是真的。<br />
        后两项不会在巴西流行（事实上，他们？）。
      </p>

    <p>
      In FIFA’s defence, the big three’s reticence owes much to their respective histories and cultures and the strength of existing sports, notably cricket in India.<br />
      And football is slowly gaining ground: in the United States the first cohort of American parents to grow up with the game are now passing it on to their children.<br />
      But that only underlines the madness of FIFA giving the cup to Qatar, not America.<br />
      And the foul air from FIFA’s headquarters in Switzerland will hardly reassure young fans in China who are heartily sick of the corruption and match-fixing in their domestic soccer leagues.<br />

      在国际足联的辩解中，最大的三个含蓄国家拥有更多对于他们自己的历史和文化和存在运动的力量，尤其是板球对于印度。<br />
      同时足球获得世界很慢：在美国父母从小到大支持的运动传给了他们的子女。<br />
      但是唯一值得提到的是国际足联的疯狂把世界杯给了卡塔尔而不是美国。<br />
      同时，在瑞士的国际足联总部的愚蠢气氛不能重获中国年轻球迷，中国球迷们被国内足球联盟的腐败和假球伤透了心。
    </p>

      <h4>A Seppless world<br />一个沉睡的世界</h4>
      <p>
        It would be good to get rid of Mr Blatter, but that would not solve FIFA’s structural problem.<br />
        Though legally incorporated as a Swiss non-profit organisation, FIFA has no master.<br />
        Those who might hold it to account, such as national or regional football organisations, depend on its cash.<br />
        High barriers to entry make it unlikely that a rival will emerge, so FIFA has a natural monopoly over international football.<br />
        An entity like this should be regulated, but FIFA answers to no government.<br />

        解雇巴拉特是一件好事，但是那并不能解决国际足联的结构性问题。<br />
        尽管是作为瑞士的非赢利组织的合法公司，国际足联并没有主管者。<br />
        那些或许预付给它，比如国家活区域的足球组织，依赖它的资金。<br />
        进入的高障碍使它不同，没有一个对手可以存在。所以国际足联有一个天生的对国际足球的垄断。<br />
        一个像这样的实体应该被管理，但是国际足联不对任何政府负责。
      </p>

      <p>
        All the same, more could be done.<br />
        The Swiss should demand a clean-up or withdraw FIFA’s favourable tax status.<br />
        Sponsors should also weigh in on graft and on the need to push forward with new technology: an immediate video review of every penalty and goal awarded would be a start.<br />

        同上，更多的可以去做。<br />
        瑞士应该需求一个清除或者退出国际足联最喜欢的纳税现状。<br />
        赞助商也应该加重？用科技推动向前：直接的对于每个点球和射门得分的视频回放将是一个开始。
      </p>

      <p>
        The hardest bit of the puzzle is the host-selection process.<br />
        One option would be to stick the World Cup in one country and leave it there; but that nation’s home team would have a big advantage, and tournaments benefit from moving between different time zones.<br />
        An economically rational option would be to give this year’s winner, and each successive champion, the option of either hosting the tournament in eight years’ time or auctioning off that right to the highest bidder.<br />
        That would favour football’s powerhouses.<br />
        But as most of them already have the stadiums, there would be less waste—and it would provide even more of an incentive to win.<br />

        最困难的问题是主办国的评选过程。<br />
        一个选项是把世界杯固定在一个国家并一直在那个国家；但是那个国家的国家队将会获得很大的优势，并且联赛将从不同时区中移动获益。<br />
        一个基于经济的合理的选项是给这年的冠军，和每个连续的关键，选项是举办联赛在8年中或者拍卖举办权给出价最高的国家。<br />
        那样将有利于足球的强大。<br />
        但是他们中的大多数已经有了体育场，这样浪费更少——同时提供更多的取胜的激励。
      </p>

      <p>
        Sadly, soccer fans are romantic nationalists, not logical economists—so our proposal stands less chance of winning than England does.<br />
        One small step towards sanity would be formally to rotate the tournament, so it went, say, from Europe to Africa to Asia to the Americas, which would at least stop intercontinental corruption.<br />
        But very little of this will happen without change at the top in Zurich.<br />

        令人失望的，足球迷是浪漫主义的公民，而不是理性的经济学家——所以我们的设想得到赢的机会比英格兰更少。<br />
        理智的一小步正式的循环联赛，所以，它将，这么说，从欧洲到非洲到亚洲到美洲，将至少停止洲际的贿赂。<br />
        但是这中间的很少会发生除非苏黎世发生改变。
