        <td>ON THE day that fighters for the Islamic State of Iraq and Greater Syria (ISIS) occupied part of a city close to Baghdad, Barack Obama announced a bold plan. It had nothing to do with the Middle East: the president plans to create the world’s largest marine reserve in the Pacific. The administration also announced a comprehensive framework to eliminate seafood fraud.</td>
        <td>在ISIS（伊拉克和大叙利亚伊斯兰国）的士兵占领巴格达附近城市的一部分的当天，奥巴马宣布了一项勇敢的计划。它对中东没有任何帮助；总统打算在太平洋上建立一支世界上最大的潜艇储备。政府也宣布了一项广泛的组织用于消除海鲜欺诈。</td>

        <td>At the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, Republicans in Congress were absorbed by the race for the position of majority whip in the House (see article), and enraged by the disappearance of e-mails from officials at the Internal Revenue Service responsible for singling out conservative groups for special scrutiny (see article). There were few reminders that six and a half years ago America had 180,000 troops stationed in Iraq to prevent the country from slipping into civil war, as now seems to be happening (see article).</td>
        <td>在宾夕法尼亚大街的另一边[译者注：连接白宫和美国国会大厦]，议会中的共和党正被在白宫中主要党位置的竞赛所吸引，同时激怒于国内税务局办公室的电子邮件的丢失，这个局负责挑选出保守组织用于特殊的监督。现在很少提起，6年半前美国有18万士兵驻扎在伊拉克为了防止这个国家走向内战，但是现在看来这个将会发生。</td>

      <tr>
        <td>The 4,500 American soldiers who died in that cause, and the hundreds of billions of dollars the country spent are, in the blunt assessment of Barry Posen of MIT, a sunk cost. Mr Posen reckons that a de facto partition is an acceptable outcome in Iraq, and that no vital interests of the sort that America should be willing to spill blood for are at stake there. This view has become mainstream (see chart). More than half of Americans think their country is less powerful than it was ten years ago, the highest share since the Pew Research Centre started asking the question in 1974. Accordingly, Americans feel less inclined to act as global policeman: the share who think America should “mind its own business internationally” is ten percentage points higher than at the end of the Vietnam war.</td>
        <td>因为这个原因，4500名美国士兵牺牲，而且上千亿美元的花费成为沉没资本，在来自MIT的Barry Posen直率的研究看来。Posen估计在伊拉克事实上的部分是可接受的结果，没有至关重要的利益使美国愿意用血的代价（的东西）在那。这种观点已经成为主流思想。一半以上的美国人觉得他们的国家的统治力不如10年前，这个比例是从Pew研究中心从1974年开始调查这个问题后最高的。因此，美国人觉得较少倾向于扮演全球警察：觉得美国应该“在国际上管好自己的事”的人的比例比越战后高了10个百分点。</td>

      <tr>
        <td>Since before he was president, Barack Obama has said that America cannot fix Iraq. As he put it in 2008: “Iraq is not going to be a perfect place, and we don't have unlimited resources to try to make it one.” Last month he set out some principles to govern the use of military power that fitted the national mood. America should use force, unilaterally if necessary, only when its core interests are threatened, he argued. He sketched out those interests with a thick enough pencil to make it unclear what they look like. Gains made by ISIS fighters in Iraq since then have added some definition. The capture of several big cities by people who have invented a new online genre, the war crime self-portrait, does not yet cross the threshold.</td>
        <td>在他还没有就任总统前，奥巴马说过美国无法恢复伊拉克。就像他在2008年所说的：“伊拉克不会变成一个完美的地方，同时我们也不必使用过多的资源来试着使伊拉克统一。”上个月，它颁布了一些适应当前国家情况的用于管理军队力量使用的原则。他提出，如果必需的（情况），美国应该单方面使用武力，只有当它的核心利益受到威胁。他用粗铅笔草拟了那些利益避免被看的清楚。从那时，在伊拉克的ISIS士兵的推进加入了一些定义。创造一种新的在线类型的民众抓拍的一些大城市的照片，战争罪行的自拍，还没有越过底线。</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>What Mr Obama has done is tell Congress that he is sending 275 soldiers to Iraq to provide security at the embassy in Baghdad. He has also sent an aircraft-carrier, along with two smaller ships carrying cruise missiles, to the Persian Gulf. John Kerry, the secretary of state, has discussed the possibility of air strikes against ISIS fighters. Mr Obama has been more cautious, saying only that any military support being for Iraq's government would be conditional on it doing a better job of including Sunnis and Kurds. Some in the administration drop broad hints that Nuri al-Maliki, Iraq’s prime minister, should go. Meanwhile, a White House official waves away questions about American air support as mere “speculation”.</td>
        <td>奥巴马所做的是告诉国会它派了275名士兵到伊拉克维护在巴格达的大使馆的安全。他也派出了一艘航空母舰，伴随着两艘较小的带着巡航导弹的船，往波斯湾驶去。国务卿John Kerry，已经讨论过对ISIS实施空中打击的可能性。奥巴马更谨慎，表示只有任何支持伊拉克政府的军队被考虑为包括逊尼派和库尔德做一项更好的工作[译：乱]。一些在政府机关的人放出充分的线索，伊拉克总理Nuri al-Maliki应该去。与此同时，白宫官方将美国控制支持的问题说成很小可能的推断。</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>The practical objections to the use of air power are surmountable. David Deptula, a retired lieutenant-general involved in planning the air campaign during Operation Desert Storm in 1991, says that the vehicles carrying ISIS fighters from one city to the next would be “tailor-made” targets if they headed for Baghdad. Nor is it necessary to have boots on the ground to direct the planes or missiles: the air force coped without them for the first 40 days of Desert Storm and drones can now hover over targets for ten hours at a time, beaming pictures back to their operators.</td>
        <td>对于使用空中力量实际上的反对是可克服的。前美国上尉计划过1991年沙漠风暴行动的David Deptula，表示ISIS武装人员的车辆从一个城市到下一个城市，如果向巴格达进发，将成为定做的目标。已经不必在降落在陆地上来引导飞机或导弹：[译：补充]空中力量现在可以在目标上方盘旋10小时，将拍摄照片发回给操作者。</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>What American forces cannot do from on high, says Mr Deptula, is push ISIS out of the cities it holds already. That could only be accomplished by the Iraqi Security Forces, perhaps with support from Iran. Iran's involvement makes America's calculation more complicated. Though the advance of ISIS fighters has put America and Iran in the strange position of rooting for the same side, the two countries are supporting different groups in Syria's civil war. And preventing Iran from building a nuclear weapon is higher on America's list of priorities than a stable Iraq. The White House has ruled out military co-operation with Iran to fight ISIS, though the two countries will talk about Iraq on the sidelines of negotiations about Iran’s nuclear capability in Vienna.</td>
        <td>Deptula说，美国武力在空中无法做到的是逼迫已经藏在城市中的ISIS退出。那必须由伊拉克安全部队来完成，或许可以得到伊朗的支持。伊朗的参与是美国的计划更加复杂。尽管ISIS武装的推进迫使美国和伊朗从根本的奇怪的位置往一个方向，但这两个国家在叙利亚内战中支持不同的组织。而且避免伊朗研发核武器在美国的次序列表中比伊拉克的稳定要高。白宫排除了军队与伊朗合作对ISIS作战的可能性，尽管两个国家将在维也纳对伊拉克边界，对伊朗核能力进行谈判。</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>Faced with a choice between siding with Iran and watching Iraq slide into civil war, most Republicans have decided that it is easier to blame Mr Obama for being weak. John Boehner, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, accused the president of “taking a nap” while ISIS marched towards Baghdad. Karl Rove, a former close adviser to George W. Bush, told Fox news that Mr Obama had squandered the influence that America had in Iraq back in 2008. Mitch McConnell, the leader of the Republican minority in the Senate, has called for Mr Obama to present a plan. The president has made it clear that he wishes to consult with Congress. Thus far the debate resembles the build-up to the decision not to intervene in Syria after Bashar Assad's troops used chemical weapons, though this time Mr Obama has not drawn any red lines.</td>
        <td>面对在支持伊朗和看着伊拉克陷入内战，大多数国家决定责备奥巴马的软弱。白宫发言人，John Boehner，指责当ISIS向巴格达进军的时候总统却在“睡觉”。小布什前顾问，Karl Rove，告诉福克斯新闻在2008年美国从伊拉克撤军时，奥巴马已经浪费了美国的影响力。在参议院，共和党的领导者Mitch McConnell，要求奥巴马拿出一个计划。总统已经做出计划并希望与国会商议。这样目前的辩论类似于在叙利亚，当阿萨德的部队使用化学武器后，集结部队做出阻碍的决定，进入这次奥巴马没有画出任何红线。</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>More constructive critics, such as Senator Bob Corker, a Republican, have called for air assistance to the Iraqi security forces but only after Iraq’s government takes steps to win back support from Sunnis. It is possible that the president will order air strikes to halt ISIS's advance, but America will do no more than that. Mr Obama has been consistent on Iraq. The invasion, he argued while running for office, had left America less safe and less able to shape events in the world. Iraq's government, he added, was suffering from the armed version of welfare dependency: “we’ve learned that when we tell Iraq’s leaders that we’ll stay as long as it takes, they take as long as they want.” For its own good, he reasons, Iraq’s government must be left to fight ISIS.</td>
        <td>更多的建设性批评家，比如参议员Bob Corker，共和党人，要求给伊拉克安全部队空中支持，但是只有当伊拉克政府重新获得逊尼派的支持后。很可能，总统将下令空中打击限制ISIS的前进，但是美国不会做的更多。奥巴马对伊拉克一贯的。在他竞选时讨论的入侵伊拉克，已经使美国更不安全并且更不会在世界上处理事件。他补充到，伊拉克政府正遭受用福利依赖的武装：我们已经知道当我们告诉伊拉克领导人如果需要我们会停留，他们就需要更长时间。他解释，为了伊拉克好，伊拉克政府应该自己与ISIS作战。</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>Even with some American air support for the government forces, the likeliest outcome in Iraq, argues Ken Pollack of Brookings, a think-tank, is now a drawn-out struggle between militias loyal to different sects. If Mr Pollack is right, Mr Obama’s claim to have ended the war in Iraq—one of the proudest achievements of his presidency—will have to be modified. America’s involvement may be largely over, but the war America started continues.</td>
        <td>智囊团布鲁斯学会的一员，Ken Pollack主张，尽管有了一些美国空中力量的支持，在伊拉克最可能的结果是忠诚于各个教派的民兵组织陷入很长的斗争。如果Pollack是对的，奥巴马声称要结束伊拉克的战争——作为在他任期内的最骄傲的成果——将被改变。美国的参与或许已经够多，但是美国开始的战争仍在继续。</td>
